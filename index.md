Here is **Tianyuan Zheng ([郑天元](https://zghydxzty.github.io/file/郑天元个人简历.pdf))**.

Focusing on the cutting-edge scientific issues of underground seepage simulation, I deeply participated in the development of the famous multi-phase flow numerical simulation software (Dumux), and was responsible for the development of the calculation modules of thermal, heat-flow coupling, fluid-structure coupling, and heat-fluid-structure coupling in the world-renowned multi-phase and multi-field coupling numerical simulation software (OpenGeoSys). I have published more than 50 papers at home and abroad, including more than 50 SCI papers, and participated in the publication of 3 English monographs. In the past 5 years, I have published **more than 40 SCI papers as the first or corresponding author in international journals**, of which **30 papers have been published in top journals** in hydrology, environment and other related fields such as WRR, JGR, JH, and **have been cited more than 600 times**. **Presided over the National Natural Science Foundation project, the Youth Fund project, the National Natural Science Foundation of China - Shandong Province Joint Fund key project project, responsible for the national Natural Science Foundation key project project, participated in the completion of the national key research and development plan project**. The research results of seawater intrusion prevention and control mainly undertaken **won the second prize of Science and Technology Progress Award of Shandong Province in 2021 (ranked 3rd)** and **the second Prize of Marine Science and Technology Innovation Award of Shandong Province in 2022 (ranked 1st)**. I am currently **a member of the Groundwater Professional Committee of the American Geophysical Union (AGU)**, and have been a reviewer of top international academic journals such as "Water Resources Research" and "Journal of Hydrology" for a long time. In 2020, I was selected into the Ocean University of China Talent Program. In 2022, I was elected as **the leader of the Youth innovation team of colleges and universities in Shandong Province**, and **the deputy editor of JournalofHydrology, a top journal in the field of hydrology**. In 2023, I was selected into **the cultivation program of Outstanding young scientific and technological talents of Ocean University of China**.
