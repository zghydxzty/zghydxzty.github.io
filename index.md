# About Me

<img src="https://zghydxzty.github.io/zghydxzty.png" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Tianyuan Zheng ([郑天元](https://zghydxzty.github.io/file/郑天元个人简历.pdf))**.

Surrounding the frontier scientific issues of underground seepage simulation, I have been deeply involved in the development of the well-known multiphase flow numerical simulation software Dumux. I am responsible for developing the computational modules in the world-renowned multiphysics and multiphase-coupled numerical simulation software OpenGeoSys, including thermodynamics, heat flow coupling, fluid-solid coupling, and thermofluid-solid coupling. I have published over 50 papers both domestically and internationally, including more than 50 papers indexed in SCI. Additionally, I have contributed to the publication of three English monographs. In the past five years, I have published **over 40 SCI papers as the first or corresponding author in international journals**, including **30 papers in top journals** such as WRR, JGR, and JH in the fields of hydrology and environment. **These papers have been cited over 600 times.**

I have led one project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, one project funded by the Youth Foundation of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and one key support project co-funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and Shandong Province. I have also been responsible for one key project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and have participated in one project under the National Key Research and Development Program. My research achievements in the study of prevention and control of seawater intrusion have **won the Second Prize of Shandong Province Science and Technology Progress Award (ranked third)** in 2021 and **the Second Prize of Shandong Province Marine Science and Technology Innovation Award (ranked first)** in 2022.

Currently, I serve as a **committee member of the Groundwater Committee of the American Geophysical Union (AGU)** and have long been a reviewer for top international academic journals such as Water Resources Research and Journal of Hydrology. I was selected for the Talent Program of Ocean University of China in 2020 and elected as the **leader of the Young Innovative Team of Higher Education Institutions in Shandong Province** in 2022. I am also the **Associate Editor of the top journal Journal of Hydrology** in the field of hydrology and have been selected for the **Excellent Young Scientific and Technological Talents Cultivation Program** of Ocean University of China in 2023.
