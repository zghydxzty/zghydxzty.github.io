Here is **Tianyuan Zheng ([郑天元](https://caihanlin.com/file/蔡汉霖简历.pdf))**.

Focusing on the cutting-edge scientific issues of underground seepage simulation, he deeply participated in the development of the famous multi-phase flow numerical simulation software (Dumux), and was responsible for the development of the calculation modules of thermal, heat-flow coupling, fluid-structure coupling, and heat-fluid-structure coupling in the world-renowned multi-phase and multi-field coupling numerical simulation software (OpenGeoSys). I have published more than 50 papers at home and abroad, including more than 50 SCI papers, and participated in the publication of 3 English monographs. In the past 5 years, I have published **more than 40 SCI papers as the first or corresponding author in international journals**, of which 30 papers have been published in top journals in hydrology, environment and other related fields such as WRR, JGR, JH, and have been cited more than 600 times. Presided over the National Natural Science Foundation project, the Youth Fund project, the National Natural Science Foundation of China - Shandong Province Joint Fund key project project, responsible for the national Natural Science Foundation key project project, participated in the completion of the national key research and development plan project. The research results of seawater intrusion prevention and control mainly undertaken won the second prize of Science and Technology Progress Award of Shandong Province in 2021 (ranked 3rd) and the second Prize of Marine Science and Technology Innovation Award of Shandong Province in 2022 (ranked 1st). I am currently a member of the Groundwater Professional Committee of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and have been a reviewer of top international academic journals such as "Water Resources Research" and "Journal of Hydrology" for a long time. In 2020, I was selected into the Ocean University of China Talent Program. In 2022, I was elected as the leader of the Youth innovation team of colleges and universities in Shandong Province, and the deputy editor of JournalofHydrology, a top journal in the field of hydrology. In 2023, I was selected into the cultivation program of Outstanding young scientific and technological talents of Ocean University of China.
